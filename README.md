# Unsupervised-Learning-Retail-Analysis
Exploring unsupervised learning techniques to analyze retail transactions and segment customers.

## Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to analyze retail transaction data from an e-commerce platform based in the UK. The primary goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms, providing insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and identifying potential target groups for marketing and sales strategies.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is from **Kaggle's "Online Retail" dataset**, contributed by **Bojan Tunguz**. The dataset includes transaction data between **01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011** for an online retail company in the UK, which primarily sells all-occasion gifts. Many of the customers are wholesalers.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle here:

## Analysis Highlights

- **Customer Segmentation**: Using unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means clustering to group customers based on purchasing frequency, recency, and monetary values (RFM analysis).
- **Sales Patterns**: Identifying trends in product sales, including which products are most popular and the times when sales peak.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Gaining insights into different customer profiles, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies for each segment.

## Key Features

- **Customer Segmentation**: Classifying customers into meaningful segments based on their purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing transaction patterns, customer profiles, and product preferences.
- **Predictive Insights**: Generating actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, product offerings, and targeted marketing campaigns.

## How to Explore
To explore this project, you can check out the following files in this repository:

1. **Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis, including customer segmentation, exploratory data analysis, and clustering.
2. **Unsupervised_Learning.py**: The Python script that runs the analysis, providing a more compact, code-only version of the notebook.
3. **Online_Retail.csv**: The original dataset used for analysis.

4. ## Dataset

The dataset is stored in a `.rar` file. Please extract it using a tool like [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to access the original CSV file.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualizations.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: For machine learning and clustering algorithms (K-Means).
- NumPy: For numerical computations.

## Notes

- The analysis in this repository assumes the dataset is in its original form and may require modifications if the data format changes.
- Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`) to run the code successfully.
